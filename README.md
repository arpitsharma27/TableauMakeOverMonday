# TableauMakeOverMonday

Tableau is one of the best Data Visualization Tools available in the market.
The Tableau Desktop version is Free.
One of the caveat for using the Tableau Desktop is that one will have to save the Visualization on his/her Tableau Profile.

For learning a new tool like Tableau, this caveat should be neglected and one should continue to learn.

If you are someone who is learning to use Tableau, then this is the best way to get your feet wet.

-To improvise upon your visualization, you can search for #MakeOverMonday on Twitter and look how others have visualized their data.

-You should be able to learn from other visualization that other folks have developed.

-Every week there is also a feedback session on how the visualization should look like.
